        "abstract": "The reducibility or fundamentality of chance in quantum physics has been a pressing issue since Bornâs 1926 clarification of the probabilistic meaning of the wavefunction. That probabilities are irreducible in the standard formalism of quantum theory became, quite early, a central tenet in the Copenhagen orthodoxy, and a theorem formulated by von Neumann in 1927 was referred to as a proof of that statement. Furthermore, the theorem is usually known as an attempt of a refutation of the possibility of hidden variables, and Bellâs 1964 severe criticism of it became quite influential. In this talkâfollowing a recent line of research developed by Jeffrey Bub, Guido Bacciagaluppi, Dennis Dieks, Michel Janssen & Tony Duncan, Chris Mitsch, and myselfâI clarify the many misunderstandings that have surrounded von Neumannâs theorem in connection with hidden variables. Furthermore (and this is the work-in-progress part of the talk), I show that Bellâs criticism, rightly cashed out, amounts to the claim that von Neumannâs result is not enough to establish the irreducibility of probabilities in the Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics. Only in 1957, with the introduction of Gleasonâs celebrated theorem, this central claim in quantum orthodoxy was firmly established.",

Conversely, critical analysis of the formal structures of our best physical theories inform central philosophical concerns, and in some cases new theorems have been proven and new lines of argument developed that are of philosophical significance. This conference series aims to bring together philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians working on such issues.\nThis yearâs event will be held on June 1-2 at LMU Munich (Munich, Germany). It will immediately precede a workshop on âOpen Systems in Physicsâ taking place on June 2-3, 2026. Our expected list of speakers includes Siska de Baerdemaeker (Stockholm), Michael Cuffaro (LMU), Alexander Franklin (KCL), Viktoria Kabel (ETH Zurich), Karim ThÃ©bault (Bristol), and Charlotte Werndl (Salzburg).\nPapers on any topic of philosophy and foundations of physics by early career researchers, especially graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, will be given priority. Submissions by scholars under-represented within the philosophy and foundations of physics community are especially encouraged. Abstracts no longer than 1000 words should be submitted via\nhttps://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/80636/submitter\nby 1 March 2026\n.\nDecisions will be communicated soon after.\nThe ILMPS conference 2026 and the workshop on âOpen Systems in Physicsâ are financially supported by the Postdoc Support Fund at LMU Munich."

How do we generate, evaluate, and integrate knowledge in medical science and practiceâespecially in an era shaped by big data, advanced statistics, and artificial intelligence? By examining the nature of evidence, causal reasoning, and explanatory models in health and healthcare, the event aims to clarify how different sources of knowledge can be combined to guide effective medical decision-making and policy. Through interdisciplinary dialogue, The Epistemology of Medicine seeks to advance philosophical understanding while contributing to the broader goals of improving patient care and promoting societal well-being.\nSpeakers\nEnno Fischer\n(TU Dresden)\nIna JÃ¤ntgen\n(LMU Munich)\nUlrich Mansmann\n(LMU Munich)\nLauren Ross\n(UC Irvine)\nJacob Stegenga\n(NUT Singapore)\nJon Williamson\n(Manchester)\nOrganizing Committee\nJÃ¼rgen Landes\n(LMU Munich)\nStephan Hartmann\n(LMU Munich)\nProgram\nTBA\nThis event is generously supported by the\nGerman Research Foundation\n(DFG) and the\nSiemens Foundation\n."

In this talk, I consider dependence statements in mathematics, such as (1). (1) The number of sides of a polygon determines the sum of its internal angles. I argue that (1) fits the general analysis provided we take an indefinite like âa polygon xâ to introduce a range of possibilities, one for each permissible value of x. Within this range of possibilities, an answer to the question \"how many sides does x have\" yields an answer to the question \"what is the sum of the internal angles of x\". Thus, the semantics of dependence statements like (1) involves a kind of intensionality that has its source in arbitrary reference. I implement this idea in a team-based extension of first-order logic that comprises (i) an operator [x] which introduces an arbitrary referent and (ii) questions concerning the value of this referent. In this logic, the above dependence claim can be regimented as follows: (2) [x]( polygon(x) -> ( value-of(num-sides(x)) -> value-of(sum-angles(x)) ) I then study how, and to what extent, such intensional claims can be reduced to extensional claims in first-order logic, such as (3): (3) âxây( polygon(x) & polygon(y) -> ( num-sides(x)=num-sides(y) -> sum-angles(x)=sum-angles(y)) As I will show, the relation between the two ways of expressing dependencies is far from straightforward.

Failures of practical rationality are typically associated with the second stage. In this talk, I consider whether the first stage â thinking of our options â falls within the scope of rational evaluation. Recently, some have argued that agents may be practically irrational for excluding particular options from consideration when these options are especially well-aligned with their values and reasons (Jeppsson, 2018). Others argue that, since option generation is spontaneous and sub-personal, the only rationally evaluable aspect at this stage is how long an agent spends thinking about their options (Wedgwood, 2017). I canvass a third possibility: the process of thinking about our options is structured by the exercise of attentional capacities and competence. This suggests that the normativity of attention is importantly intertwined with the normativity of practical rationality.",

        "description": "Abstract: Practical deliberation can be thought of as consisting of two stages: we think about our options and then (if all goes well) choose the option we consider best. Failures of practical rationality are typically associated with the second stage. In this talk, I consider whether the first stage â thinking of our options â falls within the scope of rational evaluation. Recently, some have argued that agents may be practically irrational for excluding particular options from consideration when these options are especially well-aligned with their values and reasons (Jeppsson, 2018). Others argue that, since option generation is spontaneous and sub-personal, the only rationally evaluable aspect at this stage is how long an agent spends thinking about their options (Wedgwood, 2017). I canvass a third possibility: the process of thinking about our options is structured by the exercise of attentional capacities and competence. This suggests that the normativity of attention is importantly intertwined with the normativity of practical rationality."

        "abstract": "Standard philosophical accounts (Bicchieri 2006, 2016; Brennan et al. 2013) treat social norms as rules sustained by conditional preferences to conform given (i) empirical expectations and (ii) normative expectations, backed by sanctions. While explanatorily powerful, these views impose heavy cognitive demands and strong rationality requirements. I develop a habit-based account: norms as habitual patterns of response formed through reinforcement learning (RL)âthat is, trial-and-error adjustment to social feedback. On this view, compliance, internalization, and sanctioning arise as agents learn from approval, disapproval, and payoffs. The normative force of habits appears in their stability under repetition and their sensitivity to sanctions and nudging interventions. The framework also supports norm-sensitive interventions (e.g., nudging) with guardrails against backfire.

        "description": "Title: Social Norms as Social Habits\n\nAbstract: Standard philosophical accounts (Bicchieri 2006, 2016; Brennan et al. 2013) treat social norms as rules sustained by conditional preferences to conform given (i) empirical expectations and (ii) normative expectations, backed by sanctions. While explanatorily powerful, these views impose heavy cognitive demands and strong rationality requirements. I develop a habit-based account: norms as habitual patterns of response formed through reinforcement learning (RL)âthat is, trial-and-error adjustment to social feedback. On this view, compliance, internalization, and sanctioning arise as agents learn from approval, disapproval, and payoffs. The normative force of habits appears in their stability under repetition and their sensitivity to sanctions and nudging interventions. The framework also supports norm-sensitive interventions (e.g., nudging) with guardrails against backfire. Although general, the account has digital social norms in mindâthe unwritten rules that structure online behavior. I will present multi-agent RL simulations and outline how digital reward proxiesâlikes/upvotes, reports/blocks, and moderation outcomesâlet us calibrate and test norm dynamics with platform data."

        "abstract": "The study of logic underwent a profound rebirth at the turn of the twentieth century. While logicians were traditionally concerned with the correctness of reasoning in ordinary language, Frege introduced formal languages as the primary medium and objects of logical enquiry. The shift from ordinary language to artificial languages containing formal expressions elevated the study of mathematics and philosophy to a new level of rigour and marked the beginning of the computer age.

        "description": "Title: Title: The Ontology of Formal Language\n\nAbstract: The study of logic underwent a profound rebirth at the turn of the twentieth century. While logicians were traditionally concerned with the correctness of reasoning in ordinary language, Frege introduced formal languages as the primary medium and objects of logical enquiry. The shift from ordinary language to artificial languages containing formal expressions elevated the study of mathematics and philosophy to a new level of rigour and marked the beginning of the computer age. But what exactly are formal expressions?

        "abstract": "In traditional machine learning, simplicity is often equated with model size, typically measured by the number of parameters, and smaller models are commonly thought to generalize better. This rough principle aligns with classical interpretations of Occamâs Razor, the theoretical principle according to which simpler theories should be preferred over more complex ones. Yet, modern over-parameterized neural networks challenge this relation: despite their size, they often generalize better than smaller counterparts, indicating that simplicity cannot be reduced to parameter count alone. Despite so, pruning deep learning models - the systematic removal of parameters (or weights) according to some relevance criteria - has been showed to further improve performance. By looking at some empirical and theoretical findings on pruning, particularly the so-called Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), I address this apparent contradiction by interpreting pruningâs success in deep learning not in term of size reduction, but the revealing of dynamically simpler structures already embedded within the model. As dynamic property, simplicity is expressed through modelâs stability: models that maintain coherent learning dynamics despite perturbations tend to generalize better. An extended version of the LTH experiment is used to test this hypothesis by introducing structured noise during training. The results indicate that subnetworks preserving their original initialization exhibit more stable generalization and superior performance compared to randomly reinitialized ones. Based on this, I define a new version of Ockhamâs Razor, the Dynamic Simplicity Principle , according to which models that sustain stable learning dynamics should be preferred.",

        "abstract": "In this talk I argue for a graded notion of what it is to answer a question. One upshot is that the graded notion has immediate interesting effects on norms of inquiry. Inquiry is often understood as question-directed (e.g. J. Friedman, 2013; Kelp, 2014). Evaluating question-directed inquiry depends in part on what it is to answer a question. The inquiry-focused literature tends to employ a simple notion of settling a question (e.g. Falbo, 2023; D. C. Friedman, 2025; J. Friedman, 2013, 2019) which amounts to a complete answer in the sense of Groenendijk and Stokhof (1997). Taking up and unifying the accounts by Groenendijk and Stokhof (1997) and Roberts (2012), I propose to distinguish (at least) between complete, partial, and weak answers. This result is a graded notion of answer which provides tools to represent inquisitive progress: for instance, coming to believe a weak answer is a step towards completing the inquiry, while coming to believe a complete answer settles the question, i.e. ends the inquiry. Another upshot is that this richer picture of answers to a question has interesting effects on norms of inquiry, in particular the much-discussed DBI (Don't Believe and Inquire) norm. I propose that believing an incomplete answer to a question does not prohibit inquiry into that question, but instead systematically constrains it.",

The workshop is generously supported by the\nKonrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI (relAI)\nand by the\nBavarian Ministry for Digital Affairs\n.\nIdea and Motivation\nThe notion of âpreferenceâ has a long tradition in various scientific disciplines, including economics and the social sciences, operations research and the decision sciences, psychology, and philosophy. Over the past decades, it has also been studied intensively in artificial intelligence (AI), where preferences provide a means for specifying desires in a declarative and intelligible way, a point of critical importance for effective knowledge representation and reasoning. Moreover, recommender systems often aim to learn user preferences to provide better recommendations. And, recently, alignment methods aim to improve Large Language Models to generate output that is closer to human preference. This workshop brings together researchers from different disciplines interested in preferences. The goal is to stimulate the interaction between these disciplines, to deepen the understanding of preferences and explore new perspectives, and thereby to advance the state of the art of preferences in AI.\nSpeakers\nLihi Dery (Ariel University)\nArduin Findeis (Cambridge)\nJohannes FÃ¼rnkranz (JKU Linz)\nJobst Heitzig (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research)\nTimo Kaufmann (LMU)\nDominik Klein (Utrecht)\nChristian List (LMU/MCMP)\nIgnacio Ojea Quintana (LMU/MCMP)\nJulian Rodemann (CISPA/LMU)\nZoi Terzopoulou (GATE, Jean Monnet University)\nPaolo Viappiani (CNRS and LAMSADE, University Paris Dauphine)\nProgram and registration\nProgram\n09:00 â 09:30: Welcome and opening remarks\n09:30 â 10:00: Jobst Heitzig (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research)\n10:00 â 10:30: Zoi Terzopoulou (GATE, Jean Monnet University)\n10:30 â 11:00: Christian List (LMU/MCMP)\n11:00 â 11:30: Coffee break\n11:30 â 12:00: Johannes FÃ¼rnkranz (JKU Linz)\n12:00 â 12:30: Arduin Findeis (Cambridge)\n12:30 â 13:00: Julian Rodemann (CISPA/LMU)\n13:00 â 14:30: Lunch break\n14:30 â 15:00: Lihi Dery (Ariel University)\n15:00 â 15:30: Ignacio Ojea Quintana (LMU/MCMP)\n15:30 â 16:00: Dominik Klein (Utrecht)\n16:00 â 16:30: Coffee break\n16:30 â 17:00: Paolo Viappiani (Paris Sorbonne)\n17:00 â 17:30: Timo Kaufmann (LMU)\n17:30 â 17:45: Closing remarks\nAbstracts\nJobst Heitzig (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research):\nModel-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power\nPower is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.\nThis paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humansâ bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.\nWe derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives. (Joint work with Ram Potham.)\nZoi Terzopoulou (GATE, Jean Monnet University)\n:\nLearning how to vote with principles\nCan neural networks be applied in voting, while satisfying the need for transparency in collective decisions? We propose a framework to build and evaluate neural networks that aggregate preferences, using the well-established axiomatic method of voting theory. We find that neural networks, despite being highly accurate, often fail to align with the core axioms of voting rules, revealing a disconnect between mimicking outcomes and reasoning. However, by optimizing axiom satisfaction, neural networks can synthesize new voting rules that often surpass existing ones of the literature. This talk is based on a recently published paper co-authored with Levin Hornischer (LMU Munich).\nChristian List: Collective intelligence through aggregation\nSuppose a committee, expert panel, or other group is making judgments on some issues, where these may be not just yes/no-questions, such as whether a defendant is guilty or innocent, but include variables with many possible values, such as macroeconomic or meteorological variables or travel directions. Furthermore, there may be interconnections between different issues, as in the case of economic or climate variables. How can the group arrive at âintelligentâ collective judgments, based on the group membersâ individual judgments? We investigate three challenges raised by this judgment-aggregation problem. First, reasonable methods of aggregation (such as defining the collective judgment for each issue as the average or median judgment) can produce inconsistent collective judgments. Secondly, many methods of aggregation are manipulable by strategic voting. Finally, not all methods of aggregation are conducive to tracking the truth on the issues in question. We prove new impossibility or possibility theorems on all three challenges, identifying what it takes to produce collective judgments in a consistent, truth-tracking, and non-manipulable manner and thereby to achieve collective intelligence through aggregation. Overall, the median method, though imperfect, performs reasonably well. We also note the relevance of our analysis for non-human group decisions. (Joint work with Franz Dietrich.)\nJohannes FÃ¼rnkranz (JKU Linz): On Preference Learning in Imperfect Information Domains\nIn this talk, we discuss the potential of contextual preference learning in imperfect information games. In particular, we discuss whether preferences can be used to infer the true hidden game state given the current observable context, and how they should be sampled in order to optimize the training process. We illustrate this with results from the game of Reconnaissance Blind Chess, an imperfect information variant of chess.\nArduin Findeis (Cambridge): Feedback Forensics: Understanding Human Preferences for AI Personality\nConventional AI benchmarks typically focus on the content of responses, for example checking factual (e.g. MMLU ) or mathematical correctness (e.g. GSM8k). However, for many language model applications, users' preferences also heavily depend on the manner (or âpersonalityâ) of a modelâs responses, for example how friendly or confident responses are. Recent issues with model releases highlight the limited ability of existing evaluation approaches to capture such preferences over personality traits: a ChatGPT model version was rolled back over sycophant personality issues, other modelsâ personalities have been criticised to overfit to the Chatbot Arena leaderboard.\nIn this talk, I will introduce Feedback Forensics: our newly released toolkit to measure AI personality traits encouraged in human preferences and exhibited by models. Using our toolkit, I will first share results detecting the personality traits currently encouraged by popular human feedback datasets (incl. Chatbot Arena). Next, I will discuss changes and trends in personality traits exhibited across model families and versions. The talk will feature a live demo of our personality visualisation tool and attendees are invited to follow along via our online platform: https://feedbackforensics.com/.\nJulian Rodemann (CISPA, LMU): A Statistical Case Against Empirical Human-AI Alignment\nEmpirical humanâAI alignment aims to make AI systems act in line with observed human behavior. While noble in its goals, we argue that empirical alignment can inadvertently introduce statistical biases that warrant caution. This talk argues against naÃ¯ve empirical alignment, offering axiomatic alignment as an alternative. Our argument is based on the observation that humans are reasonably good at defining rational axioms, but are rather bad at acting according to them. We substantiate this principled argument with tangible examples like human-centric decoding of language models and regulatory enforcement of alignment.\nLihi Dery (Ariel University); Iterative and Interative Peer Assessment\nIterative peer grading activities can sustain student engagement during project presentations, but their effectiveness depends on the design of both preference elicitation and preference aggregation mechanisms. Numeric grades are easy to elicit, yet students tend to award inflated scores, producing ties and sometimes strategically lowering competitorsâ grades. Full rankings avoid this inflation but impose heavy cognitive demands on students. We present a peer grading model that combines the ease of numeric grading with the discriminatory power of ranking. It integrates (a) a preference elicitation algorithm that structures how students provide evaluations and (b) a median-based voting protocol that aggregates these preferences into a ranked order with fewer ties. A classroom deployment demonstrated that this approach reduced grade inflation and strategic bias while lowering the cognitive and communicative burden on students.\nIgnacio Ojea Quintana (LMU/MCMP)\n:\nThe Reward Puzzle in Recommender Systems (with Silvia Milano)\nRecommender Systems (RS) are an ubiquitous technology affecting consumption, social relations, news information and many other important aspects of our lives. They are usually justified as a technology that identifies and maximizes usersâ preferences, by suggesting items (news, products, people) that bring the most utility to them. More generally, they are conceived as estimating a stationary distribution associated with the usersâ preferences. We believe this conceptualization of usersâ utilities or rewards is misguided, and we build on the âreward paradoxâ in reinforcement learning to illustrate the problem: the utility that a user gets from an item depends not only on exogenous variables like the item and the context in which is suggested, but also endogenous variables like mental, cognitive, or other inner states. We then model the RS task as an interaction between two agents, a recommender and a user agent. This allows us to provide more psychological depth into the user agent, and we will show some preliminary results in that direction.\nDominik Klein (Utrecht): Deliberation and consensus\nCollective preferences are frequently formed through deliberation, ideally leading to consensus among all participants. Where such deliberation is meant to be emulated or tracked with an AI system, the underlying process must be specified formally. Although there has been a significant interest in axiomatic approaches to voting, deliberation and consensus are rarely studied in an axiomatic way. We consider several standard and new axioms for deliberation and consensus, and study whether deliberation and consensus conform to these axioms. Instead of exploring general impossibility results, we consider a specific formal model of deliberation: the bounded confidence model by Hegselmann and Krause. We show that many axioms of deliberation and consensus are violated in this formal model of deliberation. We go on to argue that the violation of these axioms will likely occur in a wide class of models of deliberation and is not an artefact of the bounded confidence model. (Joint work with Hein Duijf.)\nPaolo Viappiani (Paris Sorbonne):\nNew Directions in Reasoning with Partial Preference Models and Elicitation\nIn many situations it is necessary to make decisions with incomplete or uncertain preference information. In this talk I will summarize the main approaches to reason with partial preference models and frameworks for interactive preference elicitation that iteratively ask questions to the user until a recommendation can be made with a certain degree of confidence. I will then discuss some recent applications of preference elicitation, such as computational social choice, social ranking, and algorithmic recourse.\nTimo Kaufmann (LMU): ResponseRank: Data-Efficient Reward Modeling through Preference Strength Learning\nBinary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in these signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. Signals are only considered locally within carefully constructed strata, controlling for systemic variation. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings, all while making minimal assumptions.\nOrganizers\nLevin Hornischer\nEyke HÃ¼llermeier\nRegistration\nAttendance is free but registration is required by sending an email to\nOffice.Leitgeb@lrz.uni-muenchen.de\n.\nVenue\nZEPP Library, LMU main building, room M210, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, 80539 Munich"

In their recent paper \"Classical Determinate Truth I\", Fujimoto and Halbach introduce a theory of truth and determinateness and ask whether it can be consistently extended with an axiom stating that, for every sentence, it is determinate whether it is determinate. In this talk, I show that a negative answer to this question follows as a corollary of a general impossibility result for a broad class of theories of determinateness-like predicates.

        "abstract": "Although the long-term objectivity of Bayesian inference from subjective priors is well established in complete hypothesis systems by convergence-to-truth theorems, its validity becomes questionable in open hypothesis systems, where known hypotheses form an incomplete sample space and susceptible to awareness growth. In such systems, Bayesian inference process may lead to âconvergence without truthâ: in the absence of the true hypothesis, the Bayesian posterior will tend to confirm a false view. Another long-standing challenge for Bayesianism in the open systems is how to assign credence to new hypotheses as the awareness grows. This is recognized as the \"accommodation problem\" of the \"problem of new theory\". This project aims to address these problems by developing an \"open hypothesis-system Bayesianism\". I propose a two-phase mechanism to account for the update of the credence. When no new theory emerges, the credence undergoes an incremental updating phase driven by Bayes' theorem. Here I adopt a dynamical perspective, according to which the posterior credence evolves continuously over time. A radical update phase is incurred when a theory revision takes place. This two-phase scenario indicate a possible underlying connection with Kuhn's theory of scientific paradigms and revolutions. As a case study, I will explicitly focus on the famous problem of Mercury's perihelion precession: how people's credence shifted from Newtonian gravity to general relativity as the latter was recognized to solve the puzzle. Finally, I will explore the possibility of extracting scaling laws in citation networks as indicators of Bayesian convergence in scientific practice.",
