        "description": "PhD project Title: Pluralism in Mathematical Understanding Kant's philosophy of mathematics can be viewed as an application of his epistemology to the realm of mathematics, to the effect that the mathematical understanding is justified by the use of cognitive faculties. Due to the indispensable role of Sinnlichkeit (sensitivity) within Kant's framework, his philosophy of mathematical understanding is fundamentally challenged by modern advancements in mathematics, which have evolved without leaning on sensory intuition. Recognizing this, this project seeks to formulate a new systematic account of how cognitive faculties (which correspond to Kantian \"cognitive faculties\") justify mathematical theorizing. The account modifies the Kantian strategy of attributing the justification of mathematical understanding to our cognitive faculties while embracing the paradigm(s) of modern mathematics. To achieve this objective, the project focuses on mathematical agents, individuals equipped with cognitive faculties, who enhance their understanding through inquiry processes. Through the examination of concrete cases from mathematical practice, the understanding of a mathematical agent will be argued to be characterized by: 1) her use of cognitive faculties that justify her actions performed in her processes of inquiry, and 2) the objects on which she performs these actions to form an understanding of her subject of interest. These three concepts â cognitive faculties, actions, and objects â serve the dual purpose of identifying mathematical understanding and differentiating amongst different kinds of understanding. Rooted in this analysis, the project probes the normative principles for the constitution of mathematical understanding. Given the centrality of actions within the present process-based framework, the normativity of mathematical understanding will be defined by drawing from Sosa's normative theory of performance, as exemplified by his work on virtue epistemology. This will allow comparison of different kinds of mathematical understanding across different kinds of mathematical agents. On this basis, the project's epistemological stance will be illuminated through Carnap's pluralistic stance on mathematical languages. Ultimately, this will lead the project to advocate a pluralistic conception of the constitution of mathematical understanding.",

        "description": "PhD project My PhD project is in formal epistemology. I am interested in how beliefs are modeled. Traditionally, the contents of beliefs are simply modeled as propositions, which solves but also causes a whole lot of problems. New developments suggest that beliefs are more suitably represented as something more fine-grained, which can be thought of as a proposition in a specific context, which makes belief (of a proposition) relative to a context. Another way to look at it is as belief being an \"answer to a question,\" e.g., the \"question under discussion\". Yet another way to think of these contexts is as \"subject matters\". Such a modeling of belief raises the question of how beliefs relate across changes in context/subject matter/question under discussion. My research focuses on developing an epistemic logic to express belief relative to these contexts and how beliefs change as the context shifts. This line of research sheds light on an underexplored dynamical dimension of belief systems. Key references include \"Aboutness\" by Stephen Yablo and \"The Stability Theory of Belief\" by Hannes Leitgeb.",

Throughout my academic journey, I have primarily focused on the concepts of emergence and reduction in the physical sciences, the philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics, and ongoing debates surrounding scientific realism in physics. My current PhD project centers on effective field theories, exploring both their historical development and philosophical significance. I am particularly interested in how the intertheoretic relationships among different EFTs can shed new light on, and potentially challenge, traditional philosophical notions such as emergence, reduction, and fundamentality.",

        "description": "Personal information Daniel A. Di Liscia studied philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires with a specialization in the history of late medieval and early modern philosophy (1989). With support first from the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) and later from the Antorchas Foundation, he completed his Ph. D. at the LMU MÃ¼nchen ( summa cum laude ). After three years of collaboration at the Munich Copernicus Edition, he came to the Kepler-Kommission in the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, where he worked for six years, the final four as âWissenschaftlicher Leiterâ.\n\nComplete CV (PDF, 544 KB) Interview in the magazine Ã (Diario ClarÃ­n) (PDF, 422 KB)\n\nResearch interests Daniel A. Di Lisciaâs research interest is the history of philosophy and science from late medieval to early modern times. His focus lies on two branches of research: the history of Renaissance cosmology, especially in connection with Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, and the tradition of the âcalculatorsâ. The background for both subjects is the same: the late Aristotelian tradition in logic, epistemology and, above all, natural philosophy. Late medieval history of logic and philosophy of language: theory of â consequentiae â; syllogistic and concept of deduction in medieval logic and mathematics. Late medieval physics: quantification of motion and qualities within the Aristotelian framework, nature and motion, continuum and infinite; latitude of forms and âconfigurations doctrineâ (Jacob of Naples, Nicole Oresme, Biagio Pelacani da Parma). Humanistic criticism of calculators (Juan Luis Vives). The quantification of Aristotelian metaphysics and the perfection of species (Nicholas of Amsterdam, John of Wesel, Jacques Legrand). Early modern cosmology and history of science: Gravity in Copernicus and Kepler; Kepler on pneumatics; mathematics and metrology in Kepler; the late Aristotelian Tradition and the new cosmology; Renaissance epistemology (the âmiddle sciencesâ, regressus demonstrativus and the kind of scientific proofs). Joachim Jungius and late Aristotelianism. Logic-mathematical approaches in traditional philosophical and scientific works (Richard Swineshead, Jean Buridan, Nicole Oresme, Albert of Saxony; Galileo Galilei).\n\nFurther activities in research and teaching Daniel A. Di Liscia remains active as a referee for several journals and international research foundations. In 2007, he was appointed associate member of the âCentro de Estudios FilosÃ³ficos Eugenio Pucciarelli (SecciÃ³n LÃ³gica y FilosofÃ­a de la Ciencia)â of the Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Buenos Aires . In 2008, he co-organised at Strasbourg (together with E. Mehl, UniversitÃ© Marc Bloch) the international conference: âPhysique, mÃ©taphysique, physique cÃ©leste Autour de lâAstronomia Nova de Johannes Kepler (1609)â. During 2009-2010, he participated in the Project EEDA (âUne Ãpoque en Ãdite une Autreâ) at the University of Nantes, France (Direction of the Project by Prof. E. Barbin and Prof. G. Stenger). He is collaborating member of Instituto de Filosofia , in the area of Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy of the University of Porto and participates in the project located at the same institute \" From Data to Wisdom \". Di Liscia is member of the international advisory board of the CNERU (Cordoba Near East Research Unit) . During May 2018 he organised the international conference at the MCMP \" Quantifying Aristotle. The Impact, Spread and Decline of the Calculatores Tradition \". Di Liscia has presented papers at universities across Europe, Israel and the Americas. Since the very beginning of his career, Di Liscia has connected his research work with teaching activities. As a lecturer, he has led courses regularly since 2003 on Renaissance cosmology and various other topics concerning the tradition of the âcalculatoresâ at the Renaissance Institute of the LMU and at MCMP. In addition, Di Liscia was a visiting professor at the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and Paris/Diderot (France), and at the Universities of Tres de Febrero and Buenos Aires (Argentina). Thanks to ERASMUS support, he lectured at the University of Chieti/Pescara and at the University of CÃ³rdoba (Spain). From October 2024 to May 2025, he was teaching and conducting research at the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology), Department of Humanities and Arts (https://humanities.technion.ac.il/en/staff_cat/guests/) . Di Liscia has held the role of Principal Investigator on several research projects: [1] âFrom a logic-mathematical standpoint: Richard Swineshead and the calculatores traditionâ, (funded by LMU Munichâs Institutional Strategy within the framework of the German Excellence Initiative), [2] âDie Geometrisierung der Metaphysik im SpaÌtmittelalter: Jacobus de Neapoli und die Tradition De perfectione specierum â, and [3] âIntegration und Transformation in der spÃ¤tmittelalterlichen Naturphilosophie: Jacques L",

Previously, he was Professor of Philosophy and Political Science at the London School of Economics, where, until 2024, he continued to hold a visiting professorship after his move to Munich. His work at the intersection of philosophy, economics, and political science concerns the decision-making behavior and rationality of individual agents and collectives. Another focus of his research is the metaphysics and philosophy of mind, where he is especially concerned with free will, the idea of mental causation, the concept of consciousness, and the first-person perspective. Moreover, he is interested in questions from the philosophy of science, including about the connections between different levels of description (e.g. \"micro\" vs. \"macro\" levels) in the natural and social sciences. His latest book Why Free Will is Real was published in 2019 by Harvard University Press.\n\nCurriculum vitae 2021 - Professor of Philosophy and Decision Theory, as well as co-director of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, LMU Munich 2021 - 2024 Visiting Professor, Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method, London School of Economics 2007 - 2020 Professor of Philosophy and Political Science, London School of Economics 2018 Fellow, Forschungskolleg Humanwissenschaften, Goethe University Frankfurt 2015 Visiting Professor of Law, Harvard Law School 2014 Visiting Researcher, Department of Philosophy, University of Uppsala 2014 Harsanyi Fellow, School of Philosophy, Australian National University 2011 Fellow, Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study 2006 - 2011 Visiting Researcher (three times), Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University 2009 - 2010 L.S.

In the first part, the prelude, I conduct a metatheoretical study of the notion of a formal language. In this part, I will look at several notions relating to metasemantics, conceptual engineering, Carnapian linguistic frameworks, and issues of logic, in order to ascertain what can and cannot be done in a formal language. In the second and main part, I will conduct a series of case studies by explicitly constructing fragments of formal languages, in order to investigate how useful they are for representing and solving various philosophical problems, according to the particular goals that are pursued in each case. My dissertation will result in a clearer understanding of the uses of formal languages for philosophy.\n\nFull CV (PDF, 180 KB)",

        "description": "Personal information Toby Solomon is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy at LMU Munich. His position is supported by a grant from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. In 2021 he completed his PhD at the Australian National University, with a thesis on the connection between free will and causal decision theory. In addition to a B.A. in philosophy, he holds a B.Sc. in advanced mathematics and physics, both from the University of Sydney.\n\nResearch interests Toby's Alexander von Humboldt Foundation project is entitled \"What can I do?: Modelling Option-Uncertainty in Decision Theory\".

Modern neural networks and machine learning algorithms have become both impressively and worryingly powerful, but weâre still lacking a general theory for them. Developing such a theory is a fascinating open problem at the intersection of computer science, math, philosophy, cognitive science, and other subjects. For classical computer programs, this largely has been solved: we understand their possibilities, limitations, complexity, semantics, logic, verification, safety, etc. My approach to this problem is to investigate if analogous aspects of understanding can be developed for the sub-symbolic computation of modern AI. I find it fruitful to view this kind of computation as dynamical systems; and in my PhD thesis, I developed a domain-theoretic semantics for them. My research interests outside this topic also include, e.g., the philosophy of language (hyperintensionality, synonymy, vagueness) and philosophical logic (multivalued logics, relevance logic, counterfactuals, non-monotonic logics, logical constants).

It is being conducted at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP) under the supervision of Hannes Leitgeb and Martin Fischer since October 2023. Throughout most of its history, logic has relied on certain âclassicalâ principles, such as the laws of excluded middle, non-contradiction, among others. A late outcome of the formalization of logic that began in the mid-19th century, however, is the mathematical possibility of creating logics (i.e., inference systems) that dispense with several of these principles. My research aims to explore the conditions under which it is justifiable to use a particular inference system over another, taking into account specific purposes or contexts. Thus, I delve into the implications of the existing plurality of logical systems for a unified theory of reason, addressing topics such as the universality of logic, logical pluralism, and logical evidence. Additionally, this research also intersects with several of my other academic interests, including the philosophy of science, the philosophy of mathematics, argumentation theory, and epistemology.\n\nFull CV",

        "description": "PhD project Im my dissertation, I ask one question: how is it possible that everything in the physical world is in constant motion, and that nevertheless some order is maintained? I address this question in a philosophical and historical manner by interpreting two dialogues of Plato, the Theaetetus and the Timaeus . I start with Platoâs critique of Radical Flux in the Theaetetus . I show that, according to Plato, a world in radical flux is inherently indeterminate. Then I examine the metaphysical principles Plato introduces in the cosmology of the Timaeus to account for order in the physical world. I dedicate one chapter to the Receptacle, one to Forms, and one to the Demiurge. I show how each of these metaphysical principles of the physical world help account for the latter's order, even though according to Plato it is in continuous transformation.",

He received his PhD from the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh. He also received graduate certification from the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. He received his BA in Philosophy from Rutgers University.\n\nFull CV (PDF, 202 KB)\n\nResearch interests David works at the intersection of history and philosophy of science, philosophy of cognitive science, and philosophy of neuroscience. He is currently working on the DFG project Three Methodological Problems in Memory Science (Project Number 528370787). This project addresses the philosophical dimensions of current controversies in memory science, which links the psychology of memory to its physical basis. Memory science is in an exciting state of flux, resulting from a series of provocative studies and setbacks in the dominant paradigm. The primary objective of this project is to resolve three related problems that contribute to this state of flux. First, what phenomena can be demonstrated? This is the demonstration problem . Second, where can the physical basis of memory be located? This is the localization problem . Third, by what set of criteria can memory be distinguished from non-memory? This is the demarcation problem . Together, these heretofore unresolved problems suggest that memory might depart from intuitive, scientific, and philosophical notions. With this, these problems challenge widely accepted commitments and paradigmatic success stories in cognitive science and neuroscience, as scientific study of the mind and brain long has been directed by insights about memory. At their cores, these problems are manifestations of topics in philosophy of science. They each concern a dimension of how the targets of scientific investigation are determined. For this reason, the proposed project adopts the stance that traction on resolving these problems and therefore settling these controversies can be made by philosophically analyzing memory science and its current state of flux. However, this project will do more than only settle existing controversies in memory science. These outcomes will also supply new insights into classic problems in philosophy of science. Further, these insights will have a firm basis in the realities of the scientific practice, its history, and its future. These insights will serve as a basis for informing naturalistic philosophical accounts that appeal to memory, including in epistemology, personal identity, and ethics. David is also interested in scientific reasoning. He focuses on cases in which these forms of reasoning might be flawed, and he explores the epistemic and ethical ramifications of potentially flawed reasoning. In his research, he integrates cognitive science research on biases, philosophical models of scientific reasoning, and analyses of cases from the history of science.\n\nComplete list of publications (PDF, 115 KB)",

He is currently working on the DFG project Three Methodological Problems in Memory Science (Project Number 528370787). This project addresses the philosophical dimensions of current controversies in memory science, which links the psychology of memory to its physical basis. Memory science is in an exciting state of flux, resulting from a series of provocative studies and setbacks in the dominant paradigm. The primary objective of this project is to resolve three related problems that contribute to this state of flux. First, what phenomena can be demonstrated? This is the demonstration problem . Second, where can the physical basis of memory be located? This is the localization problem . Third, by what set of criteria can memory be distinguished from non-memory? This is the demarcation problem . Together, these heretofore unresolved problems suggest that memory might depart from intuitive, scientific, and philosophical notions. With this, these problems challenge widely accepted commitments and paradigmatic success stories in cognitive science and neuroscience, as scientific study of the mind and brain long has been directed by insights about memory. At their cores, these problems are manifestations of topics in philosophy of science. They each concern a dimension of how the targets of scientific investigation are determined. For this reason, the proposed project adopts the stance that traction on resolving these problems and therefore settling these controversies can be made by philosophically analyzing memory science and its current state of flux. However, this project will do more than only settle existing controversies in memory science. These outcomes will also supply new insights into classic problems in philosophy of science. Further, these insights will have a firm basis in the realities of the scientific practice, its history, and its future. These insights will serve as a basis for informing naturalistic philosophical accounts that appeal to memory, including in epistemology, personal identity, and ethics. David is also interested in scientific reasoning. He focuses on cases in which these forms of reasoning might be flawed, and he explores the epistemic and ethical ramifications of potentially flawed reasoning. In his research, he integrates cognitive science research on biases, philosophical models of scientific reasoning, and analyses of cases from the history of science."

I am also the administrative assistant of the Mentoring Programm of Faculty 10 of LMU.\n\nPhD project My PhD project is in epistemology, where I work on fragmentation of doxastic attitudes, such as belief and justification. Fragmentation is the idea that an agent's doxastic state can be made up of multiple different fragments that might be inconsistent with each other. This is opposed to more traditional accounts, where a doxastic state has to be one big consistent \"bubble\". My dissertation is titled âFragmented Justification\". For more information, please refer to my website .\n\nResearch interests Besides epistemology, I am also interested in (doxastic) logic, philosophy of logic, specifically in questions about normativity of logic and rationality, social epistemology (judgment aggregation, social choice), philosophy of language, and philosophy of science. In philosophy of science, I am especially interested in the epistemology of complex system sciences, such as climate sciences, as well as the role values play in science. Related to this interest, in 2022, I have pursued a 5-month Blue Book traineeship at the European Commission, Directorate General CLIMA, where I worked on climate change, climate modeling and climate policy.\n\nPublications Hannah Pillin (2025).
