He received his PhD from the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh. He also received graduate certification from the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. He received his BA in Philosophy from Rutgers University. Full CV (PDF, 202 KB) Research interests David works at the intersection of history and philosophy of science, philosophy of cognitive science, and philosophy of neuroscience. He is currently working on the DFG project Three Methodological Problems in Memory Science (Project Number 528370787). This project addresses the philosophical dimensions of current controversies in memory science, which links the psychology of memory to its physical basis. Memory science is in an exciting state of flux, resulting from a series of provocative studies and setbacks in the dominant paradigm. The primary objective of this project is to resolve three related problems that contribute to this state of flux. First, what phenomena can be demonstrated? This is the demonstration problem . Second, where can the physical basis of memory be located? This is the localization problem . Third, by what set of criteria can memory be distinguished from non-memory? This is the demarcation problem . Together, these heretofore unresolved problems suggest that memory might depart from intuitive, scientific, and philosophical notions. With this, these problems challenge widely accepted commitments and paradigmatic success stories in cognitive science and neuroscience, as scientific study of the mind and brain long has been directed by insights about memory. At their cores, these problems are manifestations of topics in philosophy of science. They each concern a dimension of how the targets of scientific investigation are determined. For this reason, the proposed project adopts the stance that traction on resolving these problems and therefore settling these controversies can be made by philosophically analyzing memory science and its current state of flux. However, this project will do more than only settle existing controversies in memory science. These outcomes will also supply new insights into classic problems in philosophy of science. Further, these insights will have a firm basis in the realities of the scientific practice, its history, and its future. These insights will serve as a basis for informing naturalistic philosophical accounts that appeal to memory, including in epistemology, personal identity, and ethics. David is also interested in scientific reasoning. He focuses on cases in which these forms of reasoning might be flawed, and he explores the epistemic and ethical ramifications of potentially flawed reasoning. In his research, he integrates cognitive science research on biases, philosophical models of scientific reasoning, and analyses of cases from the history of science.

It is being conducted at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP) under the supervision of Hannes Leitgeb and Martin Fischer since October 2023. Throughout most of its history, logic has relied on certain âclassicalâ principles, such as the laws of excluded middle, non-contradiction, among others. A late outcome of the formalization of logic that began in the mid-19th century, however, is the mathematical possibility of creating logics (i.e., inference systems) that dispense with several of these principles. My research aims to explore the conditions under which it is justifiable to use a particular inference system over another, taking into account specific purposes or contexts. Thus, I delve into the implications of the existing plurality of logical systems for a unified theory of reason, addressing topics such as the universality of logic, logical pluralism, and logical evidence. Additionally, this research also intersects with several of my other academic interests, including the philosophy of science, the philosophy of mathematics, argumentation theory, and epistemology.

Before that, I obtained a Research MA in Philosophy and Economics from Erasmus University Rotterdam and a BSc in Mathematics from Leiden University. Research interests My research interests are on the intersection between philosophy of science and formal ethics. In particular, I am interested in causal concepts that are used and measured in the social sciences, which raise questions relating to causal methodology, the metaphysics of causation and ethics. I am currently working on the concept of discrimination, which I argue should be defined causally.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MA in Philosophy from the University of Lugano (USI, Switzerland), with a dissertation on the philosophy of quantum mechanics (supervisor: Tim Maudlin). As part of my MA, I spent the Fall 2023 semester as a visiting student at the University of Amsterdamâs Faculty of Science (supported by the Swiss-European Mobility Programme), where I further deepened my engagement with topics at the intersection of physics and philosophy. Research Interests My research interests encompass the history and philosophy of physics , the general philosophy of science , and the metaphysics of science . Throughout my academic journey, I have primarily focused on the concepts of emergence and reduction in the physical sciences, the philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics, and ongoing debates surrounding scientific realism in physics. My current PhD project centers on effective field theories, exploring both their historical development and philosophical significance. I am particularly interested in how the intertheoretic relationships among different EFTs can shed new light on, and potentially challenge, traditional philosophical notions such as emergence, reduction, and fundamentality. up",

She obtained her BA in Philosophy, Computer Science, and Economic Sciences from the University of Bern in 2020, and successfully completed the MA program in Logic and Philosophy of Science at the MCMP in 2022. Moreover, she is interested in ethics and policy research, for instance through her role as Research Fellow at the Solon Center for Policy Innovation from 2020 to 2023. Research interests Generally, Marina Moreno's core interests are in formal practical philosophy, including decision theory, rationality theory, game theory and social choice theory. Her doctoral project investigates the concept of well-being and its relationship to rational reasons for action. In particular, she is investigating how an individual can be understood as an intrapersonal collective, both synchronically, as a collective of conflicting internal wishes, and diachronically, as a collective of different person-stages over time. To this end, she uses various tools from traditionally interpersonal fields such as social choice theory or population ethics, in order to understand the intrapersonal domain.

It consists of two parts. In the first part, the prelude, I conduct a metatheoretical study of the notion of a formal language. In this part, I will look at several notions relating to metasemantics, conceptual engineering, Carnapian linguistic frameworks, and issues of logic, in order to ascertain what can and cannot be done in a formal language. In the second and main part, I will conduct a series of case studies by explicitly constructing fragments of formal languages, in order to investigate how useful they are for representing and solving various philosophical problems, according to the particular goals that are pursued in each case. My dissertation will result in a clearer understanding of the uses of formal languages for philosophy. Full CV (PDF, 180 KB) up",

His position is supported by a grant from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. In 2021 he completed his PhD at the Australian National University, with a thesis on the connection between free will and causal decision theory. In addition to a B.A. in philosophy, he holds a B.Sc. in advanced mathematics and physics, both from the University of Sydney. Research interests Toby's Alexander von Humboldt Foundation project is entitled \"What can I do?: Modelling Option-Uncertainty in Decision Theory\". As the title suggests, the aim of this project is to develop formal models to understand how rational decision-makers should respond to uncertainty about what their options are (or, in other words, what they can do). He also continues to think about the theme of his PhD research, namely the relationship between traditional problems of free will and decision theory. He defends a view he calls Libertarian Decision Theory: roughly, that rational decision-makers must presuppose that their choices are uncaused and unconstrained by the past and the laws of nature (though they almost certainly should not believe that). More broadly he is interested in carefully characterizing the problems, and their potential solutions, that arise when decision-makers reflect on the causes of their own choices. Some other things he has been thinking about recently include the difficulties that Causal Decision Theory has with dynamic/diachronic decision situations, deflationary truth based solutions to the semantic paradoxes, and self-referential paradoxes in decision theory.

I am also the administrative assistant of the Mentoring Programm of Faculty 10 of LMU. PhD project My PhD project is in epistemology, where I work on fragmentation of doxastic attitudes, such as belief and justification. Fragmentation is the idea that an agent's doxastic state can be made up of multiple different fragments that might be inconsistent with each other. This is opposed to more traditional accounts, where a doxastic state has to be one big consistent \"bubble\". My dissertation is titled âFragmented Justification\".

Research interests Besides epistemology, I am also interested in (doxastic) logic, philosophy of logic, specifically in questions about normativity of logic and rationality, social epistemology (judgment aggregation, social choice), philosophy of language, and philosophy of science. In philosophy of science, I am especially interested in the epistemology of complex system sciences, such as climate sciences, as well as the role values play in science. Related to this interest, in 2022, I have pursued a 5-month Blue Book traineeship at the European Commission, Directorate General CLIMA, where I worked on climate change, climate modeling and climate policy.

I obtained my M.A. in Logic and Philosophy of Science in 2019 at the MCMP. Complete CV (PDF, 150 KB) Research interests My research focuses on various aspects of logic. During my M.A., I specialised in proof-theoretic approaches for defining non-classical logics. In particular, I worked on the hyperintensional logics N4 and HYPE. These logics capture inferences in particularly refined contexts, and are useful e.g. to model a fine-grained notion of content. In the meanwhile, I started working on Strict-Tolerant logics, substructural logics that aim at avoiding semantic paradoxes while maintaining classical validities. The mere fact that such logics can be defined has repercussions for our conception of logic itself, and stresses its reliance on some properties of the consequence relation. I am now investigating both topics at a first-order level. This requires a âfreeâ approach to quantification, i.e. one that does not presuppose a denotation for all terms in every context. Later, I got interested in non-deterministic semantics applied to modal logics. This approach generalises truth-tables to output sets of values, and seems powerful enough to provide a common framework for normal and non-normal modal logics. This offers a different approach to intensionality than world-based semantics as well as a way to characterise phenomena of indeterminacy in logic. The latter is part of a larger project of mine aimed at capturing various aspects of indeterminacy and constitutes the main topic of my PhD research. Building on Carnapâs explicit definition of theoretical terms in science, I am working on a general way to denote contexts with the use of Epsilon Calculus. These structures seem to share some underlying properties of non-deterministic semantics, as well as offering new ways to define hyperintensional contexts in classical-based logics.

Carus Visting fellow MCMP Send an email Personal website CV (PDF, 58 KB) Research interests My academic training was originally in history; I was very dissatisfied with that discipline, little suspecting that it could get so much worse in years to come. I was then attracted by economics, and also got very interested in cognitive science. Eventually, when I found myself living in Hyde Park (Chicago), I gave in to the inevitable and enrolled in the philosophy graduate program there, where I encountered (among other teachers) Leonard Linsky, Bill Tait, David Malament, and Howard Stein. Also (among other students) Steve Awodey and Erich Reck. These people dragged my attention off in other directions at first, especially Howard, whose interest in his erstwhile teacher Rudolf Carnap much inspired me. But I am now finally getting around, belatedly, to applying what I learned from all those philosophers of science and mathematics at the University of Chicago to social science â which Iâm still convinced we have no idea how to do properly. Though there are individual social scientists, usually quite lonely ones, doing great work in isolated corners, none of the relevant disciplines rewards the kind of study that could actually lead to a cumulative and consistent social science with empirical integrity and sociopolitical relevance. I would like to help articulate what its goals and program might be, if the deeply ingrained incentive distortions could someday be overcome. up",

His research and teaching mainly concern the mathematical and philosophical foundations of artificial intelligence, but also neighboring fields such as theoretical computer science, systems theory, mathematical and philosophical logic, the philosophy of language, and epistemology. He obtained his doctorate from the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) of the University of Amsterdam with a project on Foundations of Analogical Thinking , for which he was funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO). Full CV (PDF, 128 KB) Research interests The main part of my research is on the foundations of artificial intelligence (AI). Modern neural networks and machine learning algorithms have become both impressively and worryingly powerful, but weâre still lacking a general theory for them. Developing such a theory is a fascinating open problem at the intersection of computer science, math, philosophy, cognitive science, and other subjects. For classical computer programs, this largely has been solved: we understand their possibilities, limitations, complexity, semantics, logic, verification, safety, etc. My approach to this problem is to investigate if analogous aspects of understanding can be developed for the sub-symbolic computation of modern AI. I find it fruitful to view this kind of computation as dynamical systems; and in my PhD thesis, I developed a domain-theoretic semantics for them. My research interests outside this topic also include, e.g., the philosophy of language (hyperintensionality, synonymy, vagueness) and philosophical logic (multivalued logics, relevance logic, counterfactuals, non-monotonic logics, logical constants). I enjoy using the tools of dynamical systems theory, domain theory, category theory, duality theory, universal algebra, constructive mathematics, modal logic, and formal epistemologyâand especially learning new ones.

I address this question in a philosophical and historical manner by interpreting two dialogues of Plato, the Theaetetus and the Timaeus . I start with Platoâs critique of Radical Flux in the Theaetetus . I show that, according to Plato, a world in radical flux is inherently indeterminate. Then I examine the metaphysical principles Plato introduces in the cosmology of the Timaeus to account for order in the physical world. I dedicate one chapter to the Receptacle, one to Forms, and one to the Demiurge. I show how each of these metaphysical principles of the physical world help account for the latter's order, even though according to Plato it is in continuous transformation. up",

Due to the indispensable role of Sinnlichkeit (sensitivity) within Kant's framework, his philosophy of mathematical understanding is fundamentally challenged by modern advancements in mathematics, which have evolved without leaning on sensory intuition. Recognizing this, this project seeks to formulate a new systematic account of how cognitive faculties (which correspond to Kantian \"cognitive faculties\") justify mathematical theorizing. The account modifies the Kantian strategy of attributing the justification of mathematical understanding to our cognitive faculties while embracing the paradigm(s) of modern mathematics. To achieve this objective, the project focuses on mathematical agents, individuals equipped with cognitive faculties, who enhance their understanding through inquiry processes. Through the examination of concrete cases from mathematical practice, the understanding of a mathematical agent will be argued to be characterized by: 1) her use of cognitive faculties that justify her actions performed in her processes of inquiry, and 2) the objects on which she performs these actions to form an understanding of her subject of interest. These three concepts â cognitive faculties, actions, and objects â serve the dual purpose of identifying mathematical understanding and differentiating amongst different kinds of understanding. Rooted in this analysis, the project probes the normative principles for the constitution of mathematical understanding. Given the centrality of actions within the present process-based framework, the normativity of mathematical understanding will be defined by drawing from Sosa's normative theory of performance, as exemplified by his work on virtue epistemology. This will allow comparison of different kinds of mathematical understanding across different kinds of mathematical agents. On this basis, the project's epistemological stance will be illuminated through Carnap's pluralistic stance on mathematical languages. Ultimately, this will lead the project to advocate a pluralistic conception of the constitution of mathematical understanding. up",

Complete CV (PDF, 544 KB) Interview in the magazine Ã (Diario ClarÃ­n) (PDF, 422 KB) Research interests Daniel A. Di Lisciaâs research interest is the history of philosophy and science from late medieval to early modern times. His focus lies on two branches of research: the history of Renaissance cosmology, especially in connection with Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, and the tradition of the âcalculatorsâ. The background for both subjects is the same: the late Aristotelian tradition in logic, epistemology and, above all, natural philosophy. Late medieval history of logic and philosophy of language: theory of â consequentiae â; syllogistic and concept of deduction in medieval logic and mathematics. Late medieval physics: quantification of motion and qualities within the Aristotelian framework, nature and motion, continuum and infinite; latitude of forms and âconfigurations doctrineâ (Jacob of Naples, Nicole Oresme, Biagio Pelacani da Parma). Humanistic criticism of calculators (Juan Luis Vives). The quantification of Aristotelian metaphysics and the perfection of species (Nicholas of Amsterdam, John of Wesel, Jacques Legrand). Early modern cosmology and history of science: Gravity in Copernicus and Kepler; Kepler on pneumatics; mathematics and metrology in Kepler; the late Aristotelian Tradition and the new cosmology; Renaissance epistemology (the âmiddle sciencesâ, regressus demonstrativus and the kind of scientific proofs). Joachim Jungius and late Aristotelianism.

I am interested in how beliefs are modeled. Traditionally, the contents of beliefs are simply modeled as propositions, which solves but also causes a whole lot of problems. New developments suggest that beliefs are more suitably represented as something more fine-grained, which can be thought of as a proposition in a specific context, which makes belief (of a proposition) relative to a context. Another way to look at it is as belief being an \"answer to a question,\" e.g., the \"question under discussion\". Yet another way to think of these contexts is as \"subject matters\". Such a modeling of belief raises the question of how beliefs relate across changes in context/subject matter/question under discussion. My research focuses on developing an epistemic logic to express belief relative to these contexts and how beliefs change as the context shifts. This line of research sheds light on an underexplored dynamical dimension of belief systems. Key references include \"Aboutness\" by Stephen Yablo and \"The Stability Theory of Belief\" by Hannes Leitgeb. up",

He obtained a PhD in artificial intelligence at the University of Groningen with a dissertation titled âLogical and Computational Approaches to Dynamics of Intelligent Interactionâ. Prior to that, he completed a masterâs degree in logic and philosophy of science at LMU Munich in 2021, and a bachelorâs degree in philosophy at the University of Florence in 2019. Research interests Edoardoâs research is concerned with the dynamics of knowledge acquisition, belief formation and opinion diffusion in social contexts. At the intersection of social epistemology and formal epistemology, Edoardo makes use of a variety of formal methods (dynamic logics, probability theory and agent-based modeling) to study information dynamics in social groups and in social networks. His current research focuses on: the development of formal frameworks for assessing the adequacy of agent communication (belief merge, preference aggregation) from the standpoint of formal learning theory; the application of Bayesian Networks and agent-based modeling to study the emergence of order effects in single-agent belief dynamics and of social anchoring effects in epistemic collectives; the application of logical tools to model social network phenomena.
